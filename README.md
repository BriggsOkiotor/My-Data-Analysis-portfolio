Updating management and agent on agents individual performance and loan recoveries in real time.

Agent individual call disposition, numbers of calls and promise to pay (PTP) from customers every three hours and consolidation of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly report analysis using advanced Excel, Power query, ETL, Power pivot with data source from Crm loan disposition sheet dataset and SharePoint.

Thereby providing data driven insight to management and quality assurance (Q/A) officers to enable them make informed business decisions judging from agents performance KPI and recovery margin. Setting a healthy competition, motivating agents by letting them know where they are in real
time, who is ahead, who is behind and how they can do better, supported by a stunning closing
remark.
Examples  are;
(Kindly  remember  to  TAG  YOUR  CALLS  PROPERLY,  Your  daily  Target  (KPI),
